	The following notes are old and not recently verified:

	With graphics, additional packages are needed:
	$ sudo apt-get install \
		build-essential libx11-dev libxpm-devel libxt-dev libxaw7-dev

	Graphics users may also want to add some old-style fonts,
	because Icon can't use client-side font rendering:
	$ sudo apt-get install xfonts-100dpi  [or -75dpi, or both]
